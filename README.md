## ðŸ”§ Practical OOP Exercises (Java + DSA Pwskills Inspired)

1. Create a parent class `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Create a child class `Dog` that overrides the `speak()` method to print `"Bark!"`.

2. Create an abstract class `Shape` with a method `area()`. Derive `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes and implement the `area()` method.

3. Implement multi-level inheritance: A class `Vehicle` with an attribute `type`, a derived class `Car`, and a further derived class `ElectricCar` with a `battery` attribute.

4. Demonstrate polymorphism using a base class `Bird` with a `fly()` method. Derive `Sparrow` and `Penguin` classes that override `fly()`.

5. Create a class `BankAccount` with private attributes and methods to `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and check balance (`get_balance()`).

6. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using a base class `Instrument` with method `play()`. Derive `Guitar` and `Piano` with their own implementations.

7. Create a class `MathOperations` with a class method `add_numbers()` and a static method `subtract_numbers()`.

8. Implement a class `Person` with a class method to count the number of person instances created.

9. Create a class `Fraction` with `numerator` and `denominator` attributes. Override `__str__()` to return the string `"numerator/denominator"`.

10. Demonstrate operator overloading by creating a class `Vector` and overriding the `+` operator to add two vectors.

11. Create a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`. Add a method `greet()` that prints a greeting message.

12. Create a class `Student` with attributes `name` and `grades`. Implement `average_grade()` to compute the average.

13. Create a class `Rectangle` with methods `set_dimensions()` and `area()`.

14. Create a class `Employee` with `calculate_salary()` based on hours and rate. Derive a class `Manager` that adds a bonus to salary.

## ðŸ›  Additional Practical Questions

15. Create a class `Product` with attributes `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. Implement `total_price()`.

16. Create an abstract class `Animal` with an abstract method `sound()`. Derive `Cow` and `Sheep` to implement the method.

17. Create a class `Book` with `title`, `author`, and `year_published`. Implement `get_book_info()`.

18. Create a class `House` with `address` and `price`. Derive a class `Mansion` that adds `number_of_rooms`.
